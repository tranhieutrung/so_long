# So-long Project - 42 School

# Overview
This is a simple 2D game that I developed as part of the "so-long" project at 42 School. It's my first game, and I aimed to keep it as straightforward as possible.

# Features
## MLX42 Integration: 
The game is built using MLX42.

## Basic Gameplay: 
The player controls a character (a ninja frog) and can collect items (cherries) while avoiding enemies (saws).

## Bonus Features
- Player Animation: The player character has a simple idle animation. When the player moves to a new position, the character's position is instantly updated rather than moving step by step.
- Enemy Animation: The enemy (a saw) has a spinning animation. However, the enemy does not move around the map, as I considered this to be outside the scope of the project.
- Movement Display: The number of movements is displayed above the player character.

## Result
Fortunately, all three evaluators agreed that it wasn't necessary to have the enemies move around the map. As a result, I archieved 125% for this project.
